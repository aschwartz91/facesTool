# facesTool
Given a list of names in a google spreadsheet (Last, First), this script puts a picture of their face in the next column. All images are sourced from the WUSTL faces service and this tool is intended to be used for clubs and other recruitment initiatives at WashU.


9/20 update: I've used this for my business fraternity's (DSP) rush of 185+ faces, also for my social fraternity's rush (100+) as well as TAMID Group's recruitment cycle of 70+ people. Saved me and my friends countless of hours of copy/pasting!
